Employee Management System (OOP with JavaScript)

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript to manage employees and managers in a company. It leverages class syntax, inheritance, and method overriding to model roles and hierarchies within an organization.

The system includes an Employee base class, a Manager subclass, and a Company class to manage the employee list.
